**贪心算法**

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not intervals: return 0
        # 按照区间的end值排序   
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])

        keep = 0
        ended = -float('inf')  
        for start, end in intervals:
            if start >= ended:
                keep += 1
                ended = end
        return len(intervals) - keep
